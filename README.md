# ECM2418 - Functional and Logic Programming

This repository contains solutions to the assignment for the module ECM2418 - Computer Languages and Representations. The coursework demonstrates the use of Functional Programming (Haskell) and Logic Programming (Prolog) to solve a series of computational problems.

- `Common.hs`: Haskell implementation for "Common Names".
- `Bilateral.pl`: Prolog implementation for "Bilateral Symmetry".
- `Prime.pl`: Prolog implementation for "In His Prime".
- `Declaration.txt`: Student declaration for ethical AI usage.

## Requirements
